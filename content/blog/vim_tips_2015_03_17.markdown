This is the start of a series of posts about better Vim usage. It's yet to be
determined how often and how frequent this will run, but expect more than just
this first post.

## Folds ##

When using manual folding, creating a fold in Vim is as easy as one command:

In normal mode, `zf<movement>`.

For example, while in Java code and on a Method opening curly brace, type
`zf%`.

And a fold is now created around that method. You can toggle it open and closed
with `za`, you can also open it with `zo` and you can close it with `zc`.

Similarly, to remove a fold created by `zf`, use `zd<movement>` to remove
folds.

From the above example, while in normal mode, typing `zd%` will remove the fold
for the method's block.

For more information about folding and the other modes, visit the [Vim wiki
page][2] on folding.

## Substitution Range ##

Here are some more explicit examples of the range options provided when doing
substitutions:

To substitute the first occurrence of the pattern in the current line:

   :s/foo/bar

All occurrences:

    :s/foo/bar/g

Entire file, first occurrence:

    :%s/foo/bar/

Entire file, all occurrences:

    :%s/foo/bar/g

Now for something completely different, specific ranges:

    :<starting line>,<ending line>s/foo/bar[/g]

End today's kicker: changing from a line to the end of the file:

    :<start>,$s/foo/bar[/g]

Visit [Vim Ranges][3] to view more information about the ranges available in
Vim.
