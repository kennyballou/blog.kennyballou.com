Configuring [[conky-github][~conky~]] to display a count and symbol of new mail turned out to be
more tricky than I had originally anticipated.  This small post quickly
explores the issues and my own misunderstandings that led to a working [[conky-github][~conky~]]
configuration and a better understanding of [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]].

I've been trying to configure [[conky-github][~conky~]] to show an icon if
there is new mail in my local [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]].  However, I'm
seemingly unable to achieve the desired result.

Here is a trimmed down version of my [[conky-github][~conky~]] configuration
for reference:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  This is using [[conky-github][~conky~]]'s new 1.10 syntax.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE toml
    conky.config = {
        out_to_x = false,
        own_window = false,
        out_to_console = true,
        background = false,
    };

    conky.text = [[
        ${mails ${HOME}/.mail/} ïƒ 
    ]];
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, when attempting to run this through [[conky-github][~conky~]], I
receive the following error:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    conky: cannot open directory
#+END_EXAMPLE

I also tried adding the ~mail_spool~ configuration setting to the
~conky.config~ table and removing the folder from the ~${mails}~ variable.
Furthermore, I tried both of the above using the ~${new_mails}~ variable as
well, similarly to no avail.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  I actually receive a different error suggesting that ~mail_spool~ is no
  longer a valid configuration setting.
  [[conky-github-search-mail-spool][Searching the code base]], I feel this is
  accurate.
#+END_QUOTE

Another variation of the above I have tried is to try quoting the directory
path, which failed with a different error suggesting [[conky-github][~conky~]]
is attempting to literally open the quoted folder.

It wasn't until I read the source of [[conky-github-mail-src][~conky~]] that I
was able to figure out what the /actual/ issue was.

What was not obvious to me from the documentation was that ~$mails~ and friends
request a literal [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]] as its parameter.  This means,
it's required to specify a folder with the triplet of folders: ~cur~, ~new~,
and ~tmp~ under it.  Without which, [[conky-github][~conky~]] returns the error
"cannot open directory" because [[conky-github][~conky~]] is trying to open the
directory ~{provided-mail-directory}/cur~ instead of the provided directory.

Therefore, to solve my issue, I had changed the path given to ~$mails~ to the
following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ${mails ${HOME}/{email-account}/INBOX}
#+END_EXAMPLE

Where ~{email-account}~ is the email account I want updates for.

This has been a frustrating experience, and the documentation around
[[conky-github][~conky~]] is unfortunately out of date.  But this is partially
my own fault, my understanding of [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]] was incorrect and
certainly led me astray.

I'm debating whether to submit a pull request for expanding the documentation
around [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]] usage in the ~$*mails~ variables but it's
likely my own misunderstanding of [[wiki-maildir][~maildir~]] that led me to so
much issue.

Next, onto [[conky-github][~conky~]]'s use of ~if_match~ and ~$battery_short~
to display different battery symbols based on "charging", "discharging" and
"full" states.
