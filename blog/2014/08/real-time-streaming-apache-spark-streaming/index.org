#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
This is the second post in a series on real-time systems tangential to the
Hadoop ecosystem. [[storm-and-kafka][Last time]], we talked about
[[kafka][Apache Kafka]] and Apache Storm for use in a real-time processing
engine.  Today, we will be exploring Apache Spark (Streaming) as part of a
real-time processing engine.
#+END_PREVIEW

** About Spark
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       03647905-6778-4ad2-919d-8878417ad092
:END:

[[spark][Apache Spark]] is a general purpose, large-scale processing engine,
recently fully inducted as an Apache project and is currently under very active
development.  As of this writing, Spark is at version 1.0.2 and 1.1 will be
released some time soon.

Spark is intended to be a drop in replacement for Hadoop MapReduce providing
the benefit of improved performance.  Combining Spark with its related projects
and libraries -- [[spark-sql][Spark SQL (formerly Shark)]],
[[spark-streaming][Spark Streaming]], [[spark-mllib][Spark MLlib]],
[[spark-graphx][GraphX]], among others -- and a very capable and promising
processing stack emerges.  Spark is capable of reading from HBase, Hive,
Cassandra, and any HDFS data source.  Not to mention the many external
libraries that enable consuming data from many more sources, e.g., hooking
Apache Kafka into Spark Streaming is trivial.  Further, the Spark Streaming
project provides the ability to continuously compute transformations on data.

*** Resilient Distributed Datasets
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b4f8ad97-133e-4ed8-bd7d-eb56c535d0cf
:END:

Apache Spark's primitive type is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD).  All
transformations, ~map~, ~join~, ~reduce~, etc., in Spark revolve around this
type.  RDD's can be created in one of three ways: /parallelizing/ (distributing
a local dataset); reading a stable, external data source, such as an HDFS file;
or transformations on existing RDD's.

In Java, parallelizing may look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
List<Integer> data = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
JavaRDD<Integer> distData = sc.parallelize(data);
#+END_SRC

Where ~sc~ defines the Spark context.

Similarly, reading a file from HDFS may look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JavaRDD<String> distFile = sc.textFile("hdfs:///data.txt");
#+END_SRC

The resiliency of RDD's comes from their [[lazy-evaluation][lazy]]
materialization and the information required to enable this lazy nature.  RDD's
are not always fully materialized but they /do/ contain enough information
(their linage) to be (re)created from a stable source [[nsdi-12][Zaharia et
al.]].

RDD's are distributed among the participating machines, and RDD transformations
are coarse-grained -- the same transformation will be applied to /every/
element in an RDD.  The number of partitions in an RDD is generally defined by
the locality of the stable source, however, the user may control this number
via repartitioning.

Another important property to mention, RDD's are actually immutable.  This
immutability can be illustrated with [[spark-programming-guide][Spark's]] Word
Count example:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JavaRDD<String> file = sc.textFile("hdfs:///data.txt");
JavaRDD<String> words = file.flatMap(
                                     new FlatMapFunction<String, String>() {
                                         public Iterable<String> call(String line) {
                                             return Arrays.asList(line.split(" "));
                                         }
                                     }
                                     );
JavaPairRDD<String, Integer> pairs = words.map(
                                               new PairFunction<String, String, Integer>() {
                                                   public Tuple2<String, Integer> call(String word) {
                                                       return new Tuple2<String, Integer>(word, 1);
                                                   }
                                               }
                                               );
JavaPairRDD<String, Integer> counts = pairs.reduceByKey(
                                                        new Function2<Integer, Integer>() {
                                                            public Integer call(Integer a, Integer b) { return a + b; }
                                                        }
                                                        );
counts.saveAsTextFile("hdfs:///data_counted.txt");
#+END_SRC

This is the canonical word count example, but here is a brief explanation: load
a file into an RDD, split the words into a new RDD, map the words into pairs
where each word is given a count (one), then reduce the counts of each word by
a key, in this case the word itself.  Notice, each operation, ~map~, ~flatMap~,
~reduceByKey~, creates a /new/ RDD.

To bring all these properties together, Resilient Distributed Datasets are
read-only, lazy distributed sets of elements that can have a chain of
transformations applied to them.  They facilitate resiliency by storing lineage
graphs of the transformations (to be) applied and they
[[data-parallelism][parallelize]] the computations by partitioning the data
among the participating machines.

*** Discretized Streams
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a9efe32f-69b7-414c-923a-85df12cf4575
:END:

Moving to Spark Streaming, the primitive is still RDD's.  However, there is
another type for encapsulating a continuous stream of data: Discretized Streams
or DStreams.  DStreams are defined as sequences of RDD's.  A DStream is created
from an input source, such as Apache Kafka, or from the transformation of
another DStream.

Turns out, programming against DStreams is /very/ similar to programming
against RDD's.  The same word count code can be slightly modified to create a
streaming word counter:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JavaReceiverInputDStream<String> lines = ssc.socketTextStream("localhost", 9999);
JavaDStream<String> words = lines.flatMap(
                                          new FlatMapFunction<String, String>() {
                                              public Iterable<String> call(String line) {
                                                  return Arrays.asList(line.split(" "));
                                              }
                                          }
                                          );
JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> pairs = words.map(
                                                   new PairFunction<String, String, Integer>() {
                                                       public Tuple2<String, Integer> call(String word) {
                                                           return new Tuple2<String, Integer>(word, 1);
                                                       }
                                                   }
                                                   );
JavaPairDStream<String, Integer> counts = pairs.reduceByKey(
                                                            new Function2<Integer, Integer>() {
                                                                public Integer call(Integer a, Integer b) { return a + b; }
                                                            }
                                                            );
counts.print();
#+END_SRC

Notice, really the only change between first example's code is the return
types.  In the streaming context, transformations are working on streams of
RDD's, Spark handles applying the functions (that work against data in the
RDD's) to the RDD's in the current batch/ DStream.

Though programming against DStreams is similar, there are indeed some
differences as well.  Chiefly, DStreams also have /statefull/ transformations.
These include sharing state between batches/ intervals and modifying the
current frame when aggregating over a sliding window.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The key idea is to treat streaming as a series of short batch jobs,
and bring down the latency of these jobs as much as possible.  This
brings many of the benefits of batch processing models to stream
processing, including clear consistency semantics and a new parallel
recovery technique...

*** Hadoop Requirements
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       70cb8acc-201e-4f63-a594-9c39987083d0
:END:

Technically speaking, Apache Spark does [[spark-faq][/not/]] require Hadoop to
be fully functional.  In a cluster setting, however, a means of sharing files
between tasks will need to be facilitated.  This could be accomplished through
[[S3][S3]], [[NFS][NFS]], or, more typically, [[HDFS][HDFS]].

*** Running Spark Applications
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bb6278e4-1d64-4902-84a3-fe4f09d4ba89
:END:

Apache Spark applications can run in [[spark-standalone][standalone mode]] or
be managed by [[YARN][YARN]]([[spark-running-yarn][Running Spark on YARN]]),
[[mesos][Mesos]]([[spark-running-mesos][Running Spark on Mesos]]), and even
[[EC2][EC2]]([[spark-running-ec2][Running Spark on EC2]]).  Furthermore, if
running under YARN or Mesos, Spark does not need to be installed to work.  That
is, Spark code can execute on YARN and Mesos clusters without change to the
cluster.

*** Language Support
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b42be48e-158e-4de0-91a7-e246c394b75d
:END:

Currently, Apache Spark supports the [[Scala][Scala]], [[Java][Java]], and
[[Python][Python]] programming languages.  Though, this post will only be
discussing examples in [[Java][Java]].

*** Initial Thoughts
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2c81e2c8-97f8-4c5a-9838-d549c2e9bce2
:END:

Getting away from the idea of directed acyclic graphs (DAG's) is -- may be --
both a bit of a leap and a benefit.  Although it is perfectly acceptable to
define Spark's transformations altogether as a DAG, this can feel awkward when
developing Spark applications.  Describing the transformations as
[[monad-programming][Monadic]] feels much more natural.  Of course, a monad
structure fits the DAG analogy quite well, especially when considered in some
of the physical analogies such as assembly lines.

Java's, and consequently Spark's, type strictness was an initial hurdle
to get accustomed.  But overall, this is good.  It means the compiler will
catch a lot of issues with transformations early.

Depending on Scala's ~Tuple[\d]~ classes feels second-class, but this is
only a minor tedium.  It's too bad current versions of Java don't have
good classes for this common structure.

YARN and Mesos integration is a very nice benefit as it allows full stack
analytics to not oversubscribe clusters.  Furthermore, it gives the ability to
add to existing infrastructure without overloading the developers and the
system administrators with /yet another/ computational suite and/or resource
manager.

On the negative side of things, dependency hell can creep into Spark projects.
Your project and Spark (and possibly Spark's dependencies) may depend on a
common artifact.  If the versions don't [[maven-dependency-hell][converge]],
many subtle problems can emerge.  There is an [[spark-939][experimental
configuration option]] to help alleviate this problem, however, for me, it
caused more problems than solved.

** Test Project: Twitter Stream Sentiment Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       61da885f-122b-4537-8fd5-3fd2aea3634e
:END:

To really test Spark (Streaming), a Twitter Sentiment Analysis project was
developed.  It's almost a direct port of the [[storm-sample-project][Storm
code]].  Though there is an external library for hooking Spark directly into
Twitter, Kafka is used so a more precise comparison of Spark and Storm can be
made.

When the processing is finished, the data are written to HDFS and posted
to a simple NodeJS application.

*** Setup
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: setup
:ID:       ade07b91-1029-4193-96fe-e13b78d1c94d
:END:

The setup is the same as
[[https://kennyballou.com/blog/2014/07/real-time-streaming-storm-and-kafka][last
time]]: 5 node Vagrant virtual cluster with each node running 64 bit
CentOS 6.5, given 1 core, and 1024MB of RAM.  Every node is running HDFS
(datanode), YARN worker nodes (nodemanager), ZooKeeper, and Kafka.  The
first node, ~node0~, is the namenode and resource manager. ~node0~ is
also running a [[http://www.docker.io/][Docker]] container with a NodeJS
application for reporting purposes.

*** Application Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b6918587-24dc-422e-844f-2a63e8c42c77
:END:

This project follows a very similar process structure as the Storm Topology
from last time.

[[file:../../../../media/SentimentAnalysisTopology.png]]

However, each node in the above graph is actually a transformation on the
current DStream and not an individual process (or group of processes).

This test project similarly uses the same [[kafka-producer][simple Kafka
producer]] developed.  This Kafka producer will be how data are ingested by the
system.

**** Kafka Receiver Stream
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: kafka-receiver-stream
:ID:       07fcc612-127d-400a-9f9e-f4eb63981a56
:END:

The data processed is received from a Kafka Stream and is implemented
via the
[[https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/external/kafka][external
Kafka]] library.  This process simply creates a connection to the Kafka
broker(s), consuming messages from the given set of topics.

***** Stripping Kafka Message IDs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: stripping-kafka-message-ids
:ID:       f31e4590-46a7-44cc-852f-b722a24286ff
:END:

It turns out the messages from Kafka are retuned as tuples, more
specifically pairs, with the message ID and the message content.  Before
continuing, the message ID is stripped and the Twitter JSON data is
passed down the pipeline.

**** Twitter Data JSON Parsing
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: twitter-data-json-parsing
:ID:       72c2e328-c683-4318-ac30-865c55cc697d
:END:

As was the case last time, the important parts (tweet ID, tweet text,
and language code) need to be extracted from the JSON.  Furthermore, this
project only parses English tweets.  Non-English tweets are filtered out
at this stage.

**** Filtering and Stemming
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: filtering-and-stemming
:ID:       b9859559-a38d-4804-b401-671f9f442085
:END:

Many tweets contain messy or otherwise unnecessary characters and
punctuation that can be safely ignored.  Moreover, there may also be many
common words that cannot be reliably scored either positively or
negatively.  At this stage, these symbols and /stop words/ should be
filtered.

**** Classifiers
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: classifiers
:ID:       cf8c297f-47c0-43e8-a7a9-87ed89abf51a
:END:

Both the Positive classifier and the Negative classifier are in separate
~map~ transformations.  The implementation of both follows the
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model][Bag-of-words]] model.

**** Joining and Scoring
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: joining-and-scoring
:ID:       cf331690-0ff6-47f4-8799-bd050fb179e0
:END:

Because the classifiers are done separately and a join is contrived, the
next step is to join the classifier scores together and actually declare
a winner.  It turns out this is quite trivial to do in Spark.

**** Reporting: HDFS and HTTP POST
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reporting-hdfs-and-http-post
:ID:       baad2be3-c3f6-47e4-88e6-b1711d9a6158
:END:

Finally, once the tweets are joined and scored, the scores need to be
reported.  This is accomplished by writing the final tuples to HDFS and
posting a JSON object of the tuple to a simple NodeJS application.

This process turned out to not be as awkward as was the case with Storm.
The ~foreachRDD~ function of DStreams is a natural way to do side-effect
inducing operations that don't necessarily transform the data.

*** Implementing the Kafka Producer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9ae134c1-87b9-480e-a10c-b1f156cb1cba
:END:

See the [[storm-kafka-streaming][post]] from last time for the details of the
Kafka producer; this has not changed.

*** Implementing the Spark Streaming Application
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       af85b05f-05ab-48e9-96fa-803af482692c
:END:

Diving into the code, here are some of the primary aspects of this project.
The full source of this test application can be found on
[[spark-sample-project][Github]].

**** Creating Spark Context, Wiring Transformation Chain
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f177b8ef-777b-4646-bd3b-1cef8f120ff2
:END:

The Spark context, the data source, and the transformations need to be defined.
Proceeding, the context needs to be started.  This is all accomplished with the
following code:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
SparkConf conf = new SparkConf()
    .setAppName("Twitter Sentiment Analysis");

if (args.length > 0)
    conf.setMaster(args[0]);
else
    conf.setMaster("local[2]");

JavaStreamingContext ssc = new JavaStreamingContext(
                                                    conf,
                                                    new Duration(2000));

Map<String, Integer> topicMap = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
topicMap.put(KAFKA_TOPIC, KAFKA_PARALLELIZATION);

JavaPairReceiverInputDStream<String, String> messages =
    KafkaUtils.createStream(
                            ssc,
                            Properties.getString("rts.spark.zkhosts"),
                            "twitter.sentimentanalysis.kafka",
                            topicMap);

JavaDStream<String> json = messages.map(
                                        new Function<Tuple2<String, String>, String>() {
                                            public String call(Tuple2<String, String> message) {
                                                return message._2();
                                            }

Some of the more trivial transforms are defined in-line.  The others are
defined in their respective files.

**** Twitter Data Filter / Parser
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       31adb1aa-8b4c-402d-8004-5523a097b582
:END:

Parsing Twitter JSON data is one of the first transformations and is
accomplished with help of the [[jackson-databind][JacksonXML Databind]]
library.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JsonNode root = mapper.readValue(tweet, JsonNode.class);
long id;
String text;
if (root.get("lang") != null &&
    "en".equals(root.get("lang").textValue()))
    {
        if (root.get("id") != null && root.get("text") != null)
            {
                id = root.get("id").longValue();
                text = root.get("text").textValue();
                return new Tuple2<Long, String>(id, text);
            }
        return null;
    }
return null;
#+END_SRC

The ~mapper~ (~ObjectMapper~) object is defined at the class level so it is not
recreated /for each/ RDD in the DStream, a minor optimization.

You may recall, this is essentially the same code as
[[storm-kafka-streaming][last time]].  The only difference really is that the
tuple is returned instead of being emitted.  Because certain situations (e.g.,
non-English tweet, malformed tweet) return null, the nulls will need to be
filtered out.  Thankfully, Spark provides a simple way to accomplish this:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JavaPairDStream<Long, String> filtered = tweets.filter(
                                                       new Function<Tuple2<Long, String>, Boolean>() {
                                                           public Boolean call(Tuple2<Long, String> tweet) {
                                                               return tweet != null;
                                                           }
                                                       }
                                                       );
#+END_SRC

**** Text Filtering
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       22771161-f84d-4383-a980-8100ab101495
:END:

As mentioned before, punctuation and other symbols are simply discarded as they
provide little to no benefit to the classifiers:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String text = tweet._2();
text = text.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z\\s]", "").trim().toLowerCase();
return new Tuple2<Long, String>(tweet._1(), text);
#+END_SRC

Similarly, common words should be discarded as well:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String text = tweet._2();
List<String> stopWords = StopWords.getWords();
for (String word : stopWords)
    {
        text = text.replaceAll("\\b" + word + "\\b", "");
    }
return new Tuple2<Long, String>(tweet._1(), text);
#+END_SRC

**** Positive and Negative Scoring
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       15e88c7c-d227-4a25-acbd-5b400509cf4f
:END:

Each classifier is defined in its own class.  Both classifiers are /very/
similar in definition.

The positive classifier is primarily defined by:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String text = tweet._2();
Set<String> posWords = PositiveWords.getWords();
String[] words = text.split(" ");
int numWords = words.length;
int numPosWords = 0;
for (String word : words)
    {
        if (posWords.contains(word))
            numPosWords++;
    }
return new Tuple2<Tuple2<Long, String>, Float>(
                                               new Tuple2<Long, String>(tweet._1(), tweet._2()),
                                               (float) numPosWords / numWords
                                               );
#+END_SRC

And the negative classifier:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String text = tweet._2();
Set<String> negWords = NegativeWords.getWords();
String[] words = text.split(" ");
int numWords = words.length;
int numPosWords = 0;
for (String word : words)
    {
        if (negWords.contains(word))
            numPosWords++;
    }
return new Tuple2<Tuple2<Long, String>, Float>(
                                               new Tuple2<Long, String>(tweet._1(), tweet._2()),
                                               (float) numPosWords / numWords
                                               );
#+END_SRC

Because both are implementing a ~PairFunction~, a join situation is contrived.
However, this could /easily/ be defined differently such that one classifier is
computed, then the next, without ever needing to join the two together.

**** Joining
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       67afc127-068d-4493-a682-99f257366e42
:END:

It turns out, joining in Spark is very easy to accomplish.  So easy in fact, it
can be handled without virtually /any/ code:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
JavaPairDStream<Tuple2<Long, String>, Tuple2<Float, Float>> joined =
    positiveTweets.join(negativeTweets);
#+END_SRC

But because working with a Tuple of nested tuples seems unwieldy, transform it
to a 4 element tuple:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public Tuple4<Long, String, Float, Float> call(
                                               Tuple2<Tuple2<Long, String>, Tuple2<Float, Float>> tweet)
{
    return new Tuple4<Long, String, Float, Float>(
                                                  tweet._1()._1(),
                                                  tweet._1()._2(),
                                                  tweet._2()._1(),
                                                  tweet._2()._2());
}
#+END_SRC

**** Scoring: Declaring Winning Class
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5e3dc2a2-7dda-4816-a3e3-e2901d4f25a2
:END:

Declaring the winning class is a matter of a simple map, comparing each class's
score and take the greatest:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String score;
if (tweet._3() >= tweet._4())
    score = "positive";
else
    score = "negative";
return new Tuple5<Long, String, Float, Float, String>(
                                                      tweet._1(),
                                                      tweet._2(),
                                                      tweet._3(),
                                                      tweet._4(),
                                                      score);
#+END_SRC

This declarer is more optimistic about the neutral case but is otherwise
very straightforward.

**** Reporting the Results
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2b6f0270-795c-4b0e-8a4c-eb0db801f4b1
:END:

Finally, the pipeline completes with writing the results to HDFS:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
if (rdd.count() <= 0) return null;
String path = Properties.getString("rts.spark.hdfs_output_file") +
    "_" +
    time.milliseconds();
rdd.saveAsTextFile(path);
#+END_SRC

And sending POST request to a NodeJS application:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
rdd.foreach(new SendPostFunction());
#+END_SRC

Where ~SendPostFunction~ is primarily given by:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
String webserver = Properties.getString("rts.spark.webserv");
HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpPost post = new HttpPost(webserver);
String content = String.format(
                               "{\"id\": \"%d\", "     +
                               "\"text\": \"%s\", "    +
                               "\"pos\": \"%f\", "     +
                               "\"neg\": \"%f\", "     +
                               "\"score\": \"%s\" }",
                               tweet._1(),
                               tweet._2(),
                               tweet._3(),
                               tweet._4(),
                               tweet._5());

try
    {
        post.setEntity(new StringEntity(content));
        HttpResponse response = client.execute(post);
        org.apache.http.util.EntityUtils.consume(response.getEntity());
    }
catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass());
        LOG.error("exception thrown while attempting to post", ex);
        LOG.trace(null, ex);
    }
#+END_SRC

Each file written to HDFS /will/ have data in it, but the data written will be
small.  A better batching procedure should be implemented so the files written
match the HDFS block size.

Similarly, a POST request is opened /for each/ scored tweet.  This can be
expensive on both the Spark Streaming batch timings and the web server
receiving the requests.  Batching here could similarly improve overall
performance of the system.

That said, writing these side-effects this way fits very naturally into
the Spark programming style.

** Summary
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2a7fb8c6-2185-4a8b-9406-d6c828885d5b
:END:

Apache Spark, in combination with Apache Kafka, has some amazing potential.
And not only in the Streaming context, but as a drop-in replacement for
traditional Hadoop MapReduce.  This combination makes it a very good candidate
for a part in an analytics engine.

Stay tuned, as the next post will be a more in-depth comparison between Apache
Spark and Apache Storm.
